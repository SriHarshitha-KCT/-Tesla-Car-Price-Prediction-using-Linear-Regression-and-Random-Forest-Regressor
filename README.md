Columns in Dataset:

Symboling:
Symboling corresponds to the degree to which the auto is more risky than its price indicates. Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its price. Then, if it is more risky (or less), this symbol is adjusted by moving it up (or down) the scale.

Aspiration:
std- A naturally aspirated engine, also known as a normally aspirated engine, and abbreviated to N/A or NA, is an internal combustion engine in which air intake depends solely on atmospheric pressure and does not have forced induction through a turbocharger or a supercharger.
Turbo- There is no denying that turbo engines have an addicting feeling of power, but they are prone to overheating and are less reliable.

Drivewheel:
fwd-front wheels powered by the engine.
rwd-rear wheels powered by the engine.
4wd-All wheels powered by the engine.

Engine Location:
Front and Rear

Fuel System:
A vehicle's fuel system comprises components that deliver fuel from the tank to the engine, including a fuel pump, fuel lines, a fuel-pressure regulator, fuel filter and fuel injectors.

Bore-Stroke Ratio:
Bore-Stroke Ratio is the ratio between the dimensions of the engine cylinder bore diameter to its piston stroke-length

Stroke:
A phase of the engine's cycle (e.g. compression stroke, exhaust stroke), during which the piston travels from top to bottom or vice versa

Compression ratios:
Compression ratios usually range from 8:1 to 10:1. A higher compression ratio -- say, from 12:1 to 14:1 -- means higher combustion efficiency. Higher compression ratios and combustion efficiency mean more power with less fuel, and fewer exhaust gases.

Horsepower:
Horsepower refers to the power an engine produces.

Peak RPM in car:
The normal RPM range for cars on highways is generally between 1500 rpm and 2000 rpm. The idle rotation ranges between 600 rpm and 1000 rpm. A diesel engine usually stays idle at around 750 rpm, while it runs at a speed of 110 km/h on 6th gear at 2000 rpm. However, petrol engines rotate at 6000 rpm at high speeds

City MPG: 
The score a car will get on average in city conditions, with stopping and starting at lower speeds.

Highway MPG: 
The average a car will get while driving on an open stretch of road without stopping or starting, typically at a higher speed.
